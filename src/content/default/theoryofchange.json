  "title": "Theory of Change: The Power of Storytelling Shapes Culture",
  "firstParagraph": "Kenya Creates was anchored in the understanding that behavior change in the SRHR space does not begin with information alone. It begins with recognition. When individuals, especially young people, see themselves reflected in complex, culturally attuned stories, they begin to engage differently. They reflect, question, share, and in some cases, reimagine what is possible. This campaign positioned storytelling as a civic and emotional access point to shift perceptions, foster dialogue, and strengthen demand for accurate, inclusive, and affirming SRHR information and services.",
  "secondParagraph": "The theory of change acknowledged the diverse environments where these stories would land: homes, classrooms, festivals, and social media feeds. Each space carries different norms and framings, shaped by moral, cultural, medical, and legal traditions. In Kenya, these framings often overlap. Religious discourse prescribes chastity, cultural norms frame sex as taboo, and biomedical knowledge remains technical and distant from lived experience. SRHR rights are protected in policy but continue to face resistance when interpreted as foreign or disruptive to established values."
