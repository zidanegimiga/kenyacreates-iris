The campaignâ€™s Theory of Change was grounded in four shifts: reflection through storytelling, conversation through dialogue, connection through trusted intermediaries, and action through advocacy and tools. This approach recognized that engagement happens in layered spaces: homes, schools, churches, festivals, the media, and social media timelines.",

Young Kenyans are surrounded by a fast-growing ecosystem of digital content that includes influencers, memes, hookup apps, and informal sex education. These voices offer a mix of empowerment, misinformation, moral judgment, and aspiration. At the same time, national conversations around SRHR remain framed by religious, cultural, and biomedical language, often leaving out the emotional and social contexts in which young people form their understanding of sex, consent, and self-worth. Formal sex education remains limited or inconsistent across the country.",
